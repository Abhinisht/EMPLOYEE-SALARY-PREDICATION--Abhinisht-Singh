# EMPLOYEE-SALARY-PREDICATION--Abhinisht-Singh
In the Project I had created an EMPLOYEE SALARY PREDICATION MODEL using Machine learning Algorithm 
<br> I had cluster the data set from the American average youth salary growth and wages dataset (adult.csv) and then applied machine learning algorithm to make  future predication using machine learning algorithm in the dataset , through which it can be used rin future to predict the salary as per their employment systtem
<br> This model truly helps the  management to intialise and channelise the growth of their employeer sequentially
<br> Feel free to give your supportive feedback and suggestion
